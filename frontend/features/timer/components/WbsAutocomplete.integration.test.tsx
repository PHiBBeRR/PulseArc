/**
 * Phase 4: WBS Autocomplete Integration Tests
 * Integration tests for WBS autocomplete with real Tauri backend
 *
 * STATUS: DEFERRED - Full Tauri integration tests require complex infrastructure setup
 *
 * RATIONALE FOR DEFERRAL:
 * - WbsAutocomplete.test.tsx (12 tests) covers all UI behavior with mocked backend
 * - Rust backend tests (51 tests) cover FTS5, TTL, caching, performance
 * - Integration tests would duplicate existing coverage
 * - Tauri test harness setup requires 4-6 hours of infrastructure work
 *
 * FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY:
 * 1. Use @tauri-apps/api/mocks for Tauri command mocking
 * 2. Create shared test utilities in shared/test/tauriTestUtils.ts:
 *    - setupTauriTest() - Initialize Tauri mock environment
 *    - seedWbsCache(elements) - Mock sap_cache_insert command
 *    - clearWbsCache() - Mock cache cleanup
 * 3. Mock invoke() to return predefined WbsElement[] arrays
 * 4. Validate UI behavior with realistic backend responses
 *
 * ALTERNATIVE: Use Playwright for full E2E tests (see feature_020_phase4_e2e_tests.rs)
