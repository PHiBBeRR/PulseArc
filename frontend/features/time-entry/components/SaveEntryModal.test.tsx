/**
 * Save Entry Modal Idle Display Tests (Phase 4)
 * Unit tests for SaveEntryModal component with idle time display
 *
 * Tests the modal for saving time entries, with special focus on displaying
 * idle time information: showing active duration and excluded idle periods.
 *
 * Test Coverage:
 * - Active Time Display: Showing time minus excluded idle periods
 * - Excluded Idle Display: Showing excluded idle time separately
 * - Format Verification: "Active: 1h 30m (Excluded: 30m idle)" format
 * - Conditional Display: Hiding idle info when no idle periods exist
 * - Kept Idle Time: Including user-approved breaks in active time
 * - Idle Breakdown: Tooltip showing detailed idle period breakdown
 * - Save Functionality: Submitting entries with idle metadata
 * - Form Validation: Project/task selection and duration checks
