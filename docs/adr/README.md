# Architecture Decision Records (ADR)

This directory contains Architecture Decision Records (ADRs) for the PulseArc project.

## What is an ADR?

An Architecture Decision Record (ADR) is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. ADRs help teams:

- Document the reasoning behind architectural choices
- Provide context for future maintainers
- Track the evolution of the system's architecture
- Facilitate onboarding of new team members
- Enable informed discussions about changes

## ADR Format

Each ADR should follow this structure:

```markdown
# ADR-XXXX: [Title]

## Status
[Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded]

## Context
What is the issue we're trying to solve? What are the constraints?

## Decision
What is the change we're proposing and/or implementing?

## Consequences
What becomes easier or more difficult as a result of this change?

## Alternatives Considered
What other options were evaluated?
```

## Creating a New ADR

1. Copy the template from an existing ADR
2. Number it sequentially (e.g., ADR-002)
3. Use a descriptive title (kebab-case)
4. Fill in all sections
5. Submit for review via Pull Request
6. Update this README with the new entry
